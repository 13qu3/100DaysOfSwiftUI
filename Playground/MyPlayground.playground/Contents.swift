//Your goal is to write a Swift playground that:

//Creates a constant holding any temperature in Celsius.
//Converts it to Fahrenheit by multiplying by 9, dividing by 5, then adding 32.
//Prints the result for the user, showing both the Celsius and Fahrenheit values.

import Cocoa

let celsius = 1.618

let fahrenheit =   celsius * 9 / 5 + 32

print("Hey look, i converted \(celsius)°C to \(fahrenheit)°F")
